        <H1 text-align="Justify">ABOUT US</H1>
        <p>WHAT DO WE DO?<br>

        MobileShop gives you a chance to quickly and easily find the phone you want and have it delivered to your home in no time, regardless of your location, as long as it is in one of the countries of the EU.</p>
        
        <p text-align="justify">WHY DO CUSTOMERS LOVE US?<br>
        
        We have been in the business for quite a while now, and it that time we have not only managed to make close relationships with numerous suppliers all over the world, but also to recognize what people need. This means that we are always able to offer all the latest phones, great prices, reliable service, fast delivery and premium customer support.</p>
        
        <p text-align="justify">The Story<br>
        
        BEGINNING<br>
        
        MobileShop website was launched in 2011, but its story actually began some 8 years before that when a group of college friends decided to go into business together. We started selling phones in shops, but our combined ambition, drive and abilities soon made us look for new challenges and new markets. Starting an online shop provided for both and allowed us to develop a strong international presence in a number of EU countries.</p>
        
        <p>TODAY<br>
        
        Collective experience of our team members and the years we have spent in the business allowed us to develop a vast network of suppliers, ensuring that our customers will always find what they are looking for. This also means that we are able to offer great prices, which are constantly being updated and follow the shifts in the market.
        
        Our affordability, fast and reliable delivery, and the fact that you will always be able to find the phone that you are looking for in our offer, have made us stand out in the market, but they are simply symptoms of our dedication to what we are doing and our desire to constantly keep improving. We know that in order to do that, we need to keep in close touch with our customers and listen to their suggestions and critiques. This is why our customer service, which is always there to answer any question that you may have, is just as willing to listen as it is to inform.</p>
        
        <p>
          Meet the team</p>
         
        
        <p>Boris  (CEO / FOUNDER)
        
        More of a free spirit - enjoys a glass of wine and a fine cigar. His enthusiasm and creativity keeps company together. His motto is: "To acquire knowledge, one must study; but to acquire wisdom, one must observe." Maybe that’s why we have a constant feeling that someone is watching us.
        
        Jelena (Web developer)
        
        Jelena is here to make sure that our site works properly and that we all know just how much work that actually involves. Seeing that we are constantly adding new phones to our offer, this can be a demanding task, but luckily (even though it doesn’t always feel that way), Jelena can be quite a demanding taskmaster. This is to say that by now most of us know what not to do and where to run if we do make a mistake that jeopardizes the site’s stability.
        
        Alex (Marketing manager)
        
        Alex tries to make sure that the only visitors to our site aren’t our well-meaning parents and friends. Even though word of mouth and our amazing brilliance in every regard are more than enough to keep attracting new customers, we like having him around so we pretend that we actually need marketing. Joking aside, Alex has done much to inform people all over EU countries about where to go if they want great prices and premium service.
        
        Tibor (Social media assistant)
        
        Another leaf of our marketing branch, Tibor represents us on social networks and ensures that Twitter is all atwitter with our news, Facebook all ablaze(book?) with new promotions and Google+ users all googly eyed over our offer. He also hates puns, but he was offered to write his own section and he declined.
        
        Diana (Sales Manager)
        
        Diana is the head of our sales team, which is to say that she is the one mostly responsible for the great deals that we are able to offer and for the fact that we’re as well stocked as we are. Considering all of this, we wouldn’t dare and be less than absolutely serious, reverential even, when talking about her.
        
        Vladan (art DIRECTOR & Web designer)
        
        If you like the way our site looks, Vladan is the one you have to thank for that. If you don’t he is the one you should probably do your best to stay away from. He constantly delights us by managing time and again to combine functionality with beauty, creativity with pragmatism and colors with other colors. He is a man with majestic imagination and all the skills required to make it a reality.
        
        Ivana (Sales Asistant)
        
        Diana is an indispensible member of our sales team, with a great eye for a bargain and an attitude that keeps us optimistic even when things aren’t exactly looking up, which would make her an amazing asset even without her sales skills. People just can’t seem to say ‘no’ to her, which, as you can imagine, can come in quite handy when your job includes negotiating deals.
        
        Daniel (Sales Assistant)
        
        When Daniel does research, things spawn into existence out of nothing just so he can discover them. He has amazingly comprehensive knowledge of the market, phones and what people need. He is the reason that we are always quick to react to any shifts in the market and able to stay in the loop.
        
        Steve  (Senior Programer)
        
        Steve has a natural affinity for clearing up any confusion or doubts, and his kind attitude makes the process quite painless and pleasant.
        
        Marco (Chat support)
        
        Sometimes we feel like Marco knows more about some aspects of our business than all of us combined. Even though he works in chat support, situations in which he acts as staff support almost merit a separate paycheck. Almost.<!-- /.row --></p>
